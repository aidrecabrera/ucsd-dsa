# Week 1

Brackets

First priority is to find the first unmatched closing bracket which either doesnâ€™t have an opening bracket before it, like ] in ](), or closes the wrong opening bracket, like } in ()[}. If there are no such mistakes, then it should find the first unmatched opening bracket without the corresponding closing bracket after it, like ( in {}([]. If there are no mistakes, text editor should inform the user that the usage of brackets is correct.
